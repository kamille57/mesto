# Welcome to my new project "Mesto"

### My first steps in JavaScript

* My website is based on Figma project
* All the buttons work properly (popup edit buttons, save buttons)
* You can like or delete cards from gallary using like or delete buttons
* Try to add your name and link in popup add form and you could see your own card in the gallery
* Mesto site is responsive and adaptive due to flex and grid 
* Classes and OOP are used in JS code
* JS code is devided into files and binded due to export/import 
* Creation of the card and validation are made with this context method
* Site is build with Webpack
* Functions are refactored for being more clear and universal
