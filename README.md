# Welcome to my new project "Mesto"

### My first steps in JavaScript

* My website is based on Figma project
* Save and Edit buttons were made with JS and work properly
* Other interactive part (like buttons, avatar change and add button) is yet to be fixed
* Mesto site is responsive and adaptive due to flex and grid 

[Please, enjoy!](https://kamille57.github.io/mesto/ "Traveller's Page")
